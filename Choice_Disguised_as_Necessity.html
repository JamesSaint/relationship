        <p>When you left your marriage and your children in 2020, you chose to live in Charlton. You chose to live in a flat you owned .... a long distance from your children. You might have believed that was your only option at the time, but it wasn’t. It was a choice. A human, understandable choice, but a choice nonetheless.</p>

        <p>You could have rented a house closer to your children .... Orpington, Halstead, Oxted .... anywhere that allowed you to stay present in their daily lives. You could have rented the London flat and used that income to cover your living costs nearby. But you didn’t. You chose Charlton.</p>

        <p>And perhaps your mind justified it: “I was a senior banker, I needed to be near London.” Yet even then, in 2020, the Global Head of Regulatory Reporting worked eight hours a day on Zoom. The world had already changed. Proximity to the office was no longer necessity .... it was identity.</p>

        <p>That moment captures something deeper that I think has quietly shaped much of your life: the way the mind can take choice and dress it in the clothing of obligation. How “I had to” replaces “I wanted to.” How “I didn’t have a choice” becomes the story that defends the deeper truth .... that sometimes you simply didn’t want to feel the discomfort of what choosing differently might mean.</p>

        <p>I don’t say this to judge you. I say it because I’ve seen how that same pattern has echoed through our relationship .... how often reality gets narrated as circumstance rather than agency. How easily “I couldn’t” replaces “I wouldn’t.” And how that subtle shift can make love feel powerless in the face of what you call life.</p>

        <p>But love thrives where there’s ownership .... where the heart says, “Yes, this is what I chose, and here’s why.” Not to be right, but to be real.</p>

        <p>Because here too, between us, there have been so many points where you’ve said, “I can’t.”<br/>
        “I can’t message tonight.”<br/>
        “I can’t come down this weekend.”<br/>
        “I can’t face that conversation.”<br/>
        “I can’t change how I am.”<br/>
        But each time, there’s a deeper truth beneath it: you won’t.<br/>
        You won’t because something in you fears what might unravel if you allowed closeness to stay consistent, or truth to stay visible, or tenderness to stay unguarded.</p>

        <p>And I understand that. Truly. You have lived a long time in a world that rewarded performance over presence .... a system that told you control equals safety. But that safety has come at a cost. It keeps you distant from the life that is trying to love you.</p>

        <p>I’ve reached a point where I can no longer carry the weight of someone else’s disowned choices. I want a partnership rooted in truth, not in “shoulds.” I want to live inside decisions that are conscious, not convenient.</p>

        <p>So I’m naming this not to shame you, but to free myself .... and maybe, in some quiet way, to offer you a mirror that could free you too.</p>

        <p>Because when we start telling the truth about our choices, life stops happening to us and begins unfolding through us. That’s where power lives. And that’s where love, if it’s still meant to, can meet us again.</p>
