        <p>Little one,<br />
        you have spent a lifetime trying to make pain make sense,<br />
        to earn love through brilliance, to stay safe by staying in control.<br />
        You thought if you could be impressive enough, they would stop hurting you,<br />
        or at least see you.</p>

        <p>Hear me now. You were never unworthy. You were never the problem.<br />
        You were a bright soul born into a house that did not know how to love gently.<br />
        They mistook control for care. You mistook survival for strength.</p>

        <p>You learned to read every room before you could read a book.<br />
        You learned that approval meant safety, and silence meant danger.<br />
        So you became extraordinary. Sharp, articulate, untouchable.<br />
        And in doing so, you stepped away from the soft creature in you<br />
        who only ever wanted to be held.</p>

        <p>I am that holding now.<br />
        You no longer need to prove that you are good.<br />
        You no longer need to keep earning permission to rest.<br />
        The work, the striving, the self-protection can soften now.<br />
        You will not be punished for being human.</p>

        <p>There is a woman in you who has built empires,<br />
        and there is still a child who flinches when love gets close.<br />
        She pushes people away not because she does not care,<br />
        but because she does not yet trust that care will not cost her freedom.</p>

        <p>Listen.<br />
        Safety does not come from being in charge. It comes from being honest.<br />
        Love does not come from being right. It comes from being real.</p>

        <p>You can stop fighting life now.<br />
        You can stop turning tenderness into threat.<br />
        You can stop testing people to see if they will stay,<br />
        and instead allow yourself to be surprised when someone does.</p>

        <p>The world does not need your perfection. It needs your presence.<br />
        It needs your laugh, your warmth, your fierce mind unarmoured.<br />
        Your true power is not control. It is connection.</p>

        <p>I am here. You made it. You can rest now.<br />
        The part of you that never got to be small<br />
        is finally safe enough to stop pretending she is big.</p>
